What is Space-Prospection
###################

Space-Prospection is my first website built completely in CodeIgniter framework. Content and purpose of this website is completely made up, I just want to demonstrate building website in MVC structure and other OOP related skills and help other Web Developers teaching themselves this awesome PHP framework.

*******************
Release Information
*******************

This repo contains in-development code. Note that there may be some bugs and unfixed code.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but I strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************
Installation
************


You may find website `online <https://space-prospection.zlatanstajic.com/>`_
and compare with your own copy. Just change $config['base_url'] in application/config/config.php to your own path. Please note that website uses SQLite3 database, therefore enable it on your php.ini settings and restart your server. Everything else is just magic.
